Hello fellow git hub people,

I make this repository as a test, for it is my first time using any repository tool. Truth be held i havent develloped an actual proyect on my own, other than for classes, so i take this first time as a chance to train my self in this kind of practice and tool.

The point of this proyect is to make a game using the bevy engine wich uses the language rust, I havent programmed a game before, I havent programmed in the rust language and of course I havent used the bevy game engine...

Anyways... Sincerely David.
